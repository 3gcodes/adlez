## Adlez

Adlez is a Zelda clone that I'm developing to learn some primative
gaming concepts. It is not meant to be consumed and used as it.
But simply a place for me to track changes.

If you are stumbling on this, you are more than welcome to use it for 
whatever you want but I'm not taking any issues or PR's at this time.

Again, this is just for me to learn about game development and 
game engine design.

The approach I'm taking is that all the problems of movements, 
collision, etc have not been solved. I'm trying to solve them on my own 
using the least amount of code possible.
